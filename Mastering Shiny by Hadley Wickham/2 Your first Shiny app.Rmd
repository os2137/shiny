## 2.1 Introduction
In this chapter, we’ll create a simple Shiny app. I’ll start by showing you the minimum boilerplate needed for a Shiny app, and then you’ll learn how to start and stop it. Next you’ll learn the two key components of every Shiny app: the UI (short for user interface) which defines how your app looks, and the server function which defines how your app works. Shiny uses reactive programming to automatically update outputs when inputs change so we’ll finish off the chapter by learning the third important component of Shiny apps: reactive expressions.

If you haven’t already installed Shiny, install it now with:

```{r}
library(shiny)
```
